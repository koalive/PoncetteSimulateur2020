# Rulebook 0.4

These are the official rules of the folkloric game of poncette, as curated by the PIF (Poncette Internationale Fédération). Despite the rules being compiled in English for the sake of product marketing and business development, poncette can be played in any desired language and the PIF only recognizes C# and Esperanto as official poncette languages.

## Requirements

To play a game of poncette, the following items are necessary but not sufficient: 

* $n$ players, with $n$ a rational number in the closed interval 2-17
* $n$ or $n/2$ devices similar to croquet mallets but designed specifically for the occasion
* a playing surface called *landscape* or *table*, between $\frac{17}{4}$ and $13$ hands wide and between $\frac{17}{2}$ and $39$ hands long.
* water, beer or oil-based solvant to lubricate the gaming surface (the game is traditionally played on rainy days).

## Technical considerations

* Distance are measured in hands which are equivalent two 26.5 centimeters based on the judgement of the referee.
* The narrower the landscape is, the harder and more technical it gets for the contestants. Official league games are often played on tables of $\frac{23}{4} \times \frac{31}{3}$ hands referred to as *table du ping pong*.
