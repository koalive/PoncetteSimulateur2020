# Rulebook 0.4

These are the official rules of the folkloric game of poncette, as curated by the PIF (Poncette Internationale Fédération). Despite the rules being compiled in English for the sake of product marketing and business development, poncette can be played in any desired language and the PIF only recognizes C# and Esperanto as official poncette languages.

## Requirements

To play a game of poncette, the following items are necessary but not sufficient: 

* <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n"> players, with <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n"> a rational number in the closed interval 2-17
* <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n"> or <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{n}{2}"> devices similar to croquet mallets but designed specifically for the occasion
* Projectiles that can be:
    * one, two or three spheres (or hyperspheres) of similar radius inferior to one hand
    * one or two ellipses (or ellipsoids) of similar semi-major axis inferior to one hand.
* a playing surface called *landscape* or *table*, between <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{17}{4}"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=13"> hands wide and between <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{17}{2}"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=39"> hands long. It should be divided along its length in two parts of equal surface area and perimeter, either by a permeable membrane, a groove or a net allowing 
* water, beer or oil-based solvant to lubricate the gaming surface (the game is traditionally played on rainy days).

## Technical considerations

* Distance are measured in hands which are equivalent two 26.5 centimeters based on the judgement of the referee.
* The narrower the landscape is, the harder and more technical it gets for the contestants. Official league games are often played on tables of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{23}{4} \times \frac{31}{3}"> hands referred to as *table du ping pong*.
* Note that projectiles are spheres or ellipsoids and are therefore empty. It is therefore not possible to play with marbles or foosball balls but can be played with up to two rugby balls or three table tennis balls.
